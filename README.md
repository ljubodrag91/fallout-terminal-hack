# fallout-terminal-hack
My recreation of terminal hack mini game from fallout series.

Gameplay:

  -You start game with 10 different words,of witch one is the password
  -Guess the password by clicking on word
  -If you guess correctly,winning screen is shown
  -If you didn't guess correctly, the terminal will display likeness score,showing how many letters from selected word are in same
    location as in password
  -If you get four wrong guesses,loosing screen is shown
  -There are also things you can do with the characters that are not part of words. 
    Clicking on matching brackets ( () [] {} <>, even with other characters between, but not a whole word between) 
    can remove a dud password or reset the number of remaining guesses to four. 
    The brackets must be of the same type and on the same line.

Features:
  -Sound
  -Highlight effects
  -Difficulty (novice,advanced,expert,master),higher the difficulty,bigger the words
